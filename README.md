## Folder 

[notebook_version_code](https://github.com/Brian1357/STA663-Project-LSHLink/tree/master/notebook_version_code): This folder contains the Single_linkage code, original LSHlink code, numba version code and Cython version code. The Single Linkage Method is the most basic algorithm. This paper based on single linkage algorithm provides LSHlink algorithm. We realize the LSHlink algorithm in Python and optimize it in Cython or Numba.
We recommend the Cython version code and we will go into details about this release.

[numba_version_package](https://github.com/Brian1357/STA663-Project-LSHLink/tree/master/numba_version_package): This folder contains numba version package, we recommend the Cython version package.

[report](https://github.com/Brian1357/STA663-Project-LSHLink/tree/master/report): This folder contains our final report.
